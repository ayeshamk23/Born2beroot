# 👑 Born2beroot – System Administration at 42

> _“Secure your system like a real root.”_


## 📚 Project Overview

Born2beroot is a system administration project from 42 School, completed on 25 November 2023. It focuses on setting up, securing, and managing a Linux-based virtual machine. The goal is to apply essential DevOps and security practices such as partitioning with LVM, managing users and groups, enforcing strong password policies, and configuring key services like sudo, UFW, and SSH.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- 🐧 **Debian 11** or **Rocky Linux 9**
- 🛠️ **VirtualBox** / **UFW**
- 🔐 **Sudo**, **SSH**, **Passwords**
- 💾 **LVM** (Logical Volume Manager)


## 🛠️ Key Configurations

- ✅ Partitioning using LVM
- ✅ Strong password & login policies (`passwd`, `pam`, `login.defs`)
- ✅ Sudo configuration with a custom group (`sudo` or `admin`)
- ✅ Secure SSH setup (port change, limited users, key auth)
- ✅ UFW firewall rules enabled
- ✅ Hostname and system info monitoring via `cron` + custom script
- ✅ Root login disabled & system hardening



## 🧠 Concepts Learned

- Linux user and permission management
- Securing systems against unauthorized access
- Automating admin tasks with cron
- Managing partitions with LVM
- Using SSH and UFW for secure access
